1. Input Assumptions:
Here are some potential input features:

Budget: The amount spent on each campaign.
Clicks/Impressions: The number of people who saw or clicked on the ads.
Cost per Click (CPC): The cost of each click on the advertisement.
Conversion Rate: The percentage of people who clicked on the ad and made a purchase or took another valuable action.
Platform: Whether the campaign is running on META or Google.
Ad Engagement: The level of interaction, such as likes, comments, or shares (for META) or click-through rate (for Google).
Target Audience Demographics: Age, gender, location, etc.
Campaign Duration: The length of time the campaign has been running.
Historical ROI Data: If available, use historical campaign ROI to train a model.

2. Define the Output:
The output of the program should be the predicted ROI, which can be calculated as:
ùëÖùëÇùêº = (Revenue ‚àí Cost) / Cost * 100
We want to predict the revenue from the input features to calculate the ROI.

3. Model Selection:
Since this is a regression problem (predicting continuous values like revenue or ROI), you could use machine learning models such as:

Linear Regression: If the relationship between inputs and ROI is mostly linear.
Random Forest or Gradient Boosting: These can capture more complex, non-linear relationships.
Neural Networks: If you want to capture very complex patterns, though it requires more data.

4. Data Preprocessing:
Normalize or standardize numerical inputs like budget, CPC, and impressions.
Convert categorical data (like platform, demographics) into numerical format using techniques like one-hot encoding.
Handle missing data, outliers, and scale the data appropriately for the model you choose.

5. Program Structure
Build the actual python program.

6. Model Evaluation:
Once the model is trained, evaluate it using metrics such as:

Mean Squared Error (MSE) for regression tasks.
R-squared (R¬≤) score to understand how well the model fits the data.

7. Clarity on the Approach:
Input Assumptions: For simplicity, we used a small set of inputs like budget, clicks, CPC, and conversions, but more features could be added if available.
Model Choice: Random Forest is used for its ability to handle non-linear relationships, though other models can be tried based on the complexity of the data.
Predictive Task: We aim to predict ROI, which helps gauge the success of future campaigns.

8. Output
Mean Squared Error: 36.0
Predicted ROI for new campaign: 291.0
